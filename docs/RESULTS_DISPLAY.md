# Results Display Specification

This document describes how the user's results will be presented after completing the questionnaire.

## 1. Primary Visualization: Radar Chart ("Spiky Profile")

The main feature of the results screen will be a radar chart (also known as a spider or star chart) that provides a "spiky profile" of the user's privilege across all categories. Each category from the questionnaire will be an axis on the chart. This offers an immediate, powerful visual summary of where their societal advantages and disadvantages lie.

## 2. Cumulative Score

Directly beneath the radar chart, a single, prominently displayed cumulative score will be shown (e.g., "Overall Score: 78/100"). This provides a simple, at-a-glance summary of their results.

## 3. Detailed Explanations (Interactive)

The results screen will also provide detailed explanations for each category. The radar chart or a corresponding legend will be interactive, allowing the user to select a specific category to learn more about their score in that area.

When a category is selected, the app will display explanatory text that provides context and information about what the score in that category means. The UI for this interaction could be one of the following:

*   **Accordion:** An expanding and collapsing section directly on the results screen.
*   **Dialog/Bottom Sheet:** A modal popup or a sheet that slides up from the bottom.
*   **Detail Page:** Navigating to a new, dedicated page for that category's detailed results.
