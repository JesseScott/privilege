# User Experience (UX) Specification

This document outlines the core user experience and flow of the Privilege application.

## Questionnaire Flow

The questionnaire will be presented to the user one question at a time. This focused approach is designed to encourage thoughtful consideration of each question without overwhelming the user.

- **Progression:** Users will navigate through the questions sequentially. Animated transitions between questions will be used to create a smooth and polished feel.

- **Navigation:** Upon answering a question, the app will automatically advance to the next one.

- **Progress Indication:** A progress bar will be visible at the bottom of the screen at all times during the questionnaire. This bar will not only show the user's overall progress but will also act as a "breadcrumb" indicator, displaying the current category of questions (e.g., "Socioeconomic Status").
