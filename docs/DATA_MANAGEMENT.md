# Data Management and Architecture

This document outlines the strategy for managing the questionnaire's content and the architectural principles guiding data flow.

## 1. Architectural Approach: Clean Architecture

The project will follow Clean Architecture principles to ensure a separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. A key aspect of this will be the use of the Repository pattern to abstract the data source from the rest of the application.

## 2. Initial Data Source (Phase 1): Bundled JSON

Initially, all questionnaire content—including categories, questions, and scoring logic—will be stored in a JSON file bundled within the application's assets. 

- **Data Flow:** A `QuestionnaireRepository` will be responsible for reading and parsing this JSON file. It will deserialize the JSON objects into domain-specific data classes (e.g., `Question`, `Category`). The UI and business logic layers of the app will interact only with these data objects, remaining completely unaware of the JSON data source.

## 3. Future Data Source (Phase 2): Remote Server

The architecture will be designed to seamlessly transition to a remote data source in the future.

- **Evolution Plan:** The `QuestionnaireRepository`'s implementation will be updated to fetch the questionnaire content from a lightweight backend server.
- **Versioning:** The app will manage content versions. It can cache the latest version of the questionnaire locally. When the app starts, it can quickly check with the server if a newer version of the content is available and download it if necessary. This allows for dynamic updates without requiring a full app release.
